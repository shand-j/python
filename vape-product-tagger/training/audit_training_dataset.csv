<p><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Directions:</strong><span data-mce-fragment=""1""> Please shake well before use. 4-10 drops to be taken twice a day. Maximum daily dosage 200mg. For optimal results the oil must be taken sublingually. Place the required dosage/drops under the tongue and hold it there for 2-3 minutes. The CBD will enter the bloodstream within 10-15 minutes. This is the most effective way to take CBD Oil as swallowing immediately will decrease absorption within the body.</span><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">Each bottle of CBD contains 10ml, this equates to roughly 200 drops of CBD oil per bottle. As an example, someone using 4 drops of CBD oil per day will see the bottle last 50 days. If you use 6 drops per day, that would amount to lasting just over 33 days. To work out exactly how often you need to reorder, divide 200 by the amount of drops per day you are using and you will see exactly how many days your bottle will last.</span><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><strong data-mce-fragment=""1"">Ingredients:</strong><span data-mce-fragment=""1""> CBD, Cannabis Sativa L., MCT Oil</span><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><br data-mce-fragment=""1""><span data-mce-fragment=""1"">THC Content&lt;0.2%</span></p>","CBD,tincture,full_spectrum,1000mg,10ml,pen_style","CBD,full_spectrum,oil,10ml","full_spectrum,tincture,1000mg",CBD,,,,,
